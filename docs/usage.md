# Usage

_script.sh_:

```shell
echo "Hello World"
```

To build this script, simply run:

```shell
bunster build script.sh -o my-program
```

This will create an executable program named `my-program` in the current working directory.

Now you can run it

```shell
./my-program
# Output: Hello World
```
