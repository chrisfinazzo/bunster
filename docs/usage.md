# Usage

_script.sh_:

```shell
echo "Hello World"
```

To build this script, simply run:

```shell

bunster build script.sh -o ./bin/my-program

```

This will create an executable program named `my-program` in the `./bin` directory.

Now you can run it

```shell

./bin/my-program


# Output: Hello World
```
